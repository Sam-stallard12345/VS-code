Frontend Development Stages
1. Initial Wireframes and Prototyping

    Created low-fidelity wireframes to define the structure and layout of key pages:
        Homepage: Focused on destination discovery with a clean hero section and featured content.
        Search Page: Included filters for region, activity type, and budget.
        Itinerary Builder: Designed an interactive, drag-and-drop interface for trip planning.
    Tools Used: Figma for wireframes and design mockups.

2. Setting Up the Project Structure

    Initialized the project using Vite for a fast development environment.
    Organized a scalable folder structure for components, assets, and styles:

    src/
    ├── components/
    ├── pages/
    ├── assets/
    ├── hooks/
    ├── styles/
    └── utils/

3. Responsive Design Implementation

    Built a fully responsive UI to ensure seamless user experiences across devices:
        Used CSS Flexbox and Grid for layout.
        Styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent styling.
        Tested responsiveness with browser developer tools and real devices.

4. Component Development

    Developed reusable and modular React components:
        Navbar: Dynamic navigation with a collapsible menu for mobile screens.
        Destination Cards: Responsive cards with hover effects for displaying destination details.
        Search Bar: Auto-complete functionality for quick location lookup.
        Itinerary Planner: Interactive drag-and-drop feature for customizing travel plans.

5. Integration of APIs

    Connected the frontend to external APIs for dynamic data rendering:
        Displayed travel advisories, weather data, and featured destinations.
        Built loading and error states to handle API responses gracefully.
    Tools Used: Axios for API requests, with error handling for robustness.

6. State Management

    Implemented React Context API for managing global state:
        User session data (e.g., saved itineraries, authentication tokens).
        Shared state for search filters and dynamic content rendering.
    Prepared for future scalability with modular state management patterns.

7. Accessibility and User Experience Enhancements

    Followed WCAG 2.1 guidelines to ensure an inclusive design:
        Added ARIA roles and labels for improved screen reader support.
        Enhanced keyboard navigation for interactive components.
    Focused on performance optimizations:
        Lazy-loaded images and components to improve page load times.
        Minimized render-blocking resources using Vite’s optimization.

8. Testing and Refinement

    Conducted rigorous testing to ensure reliability:
        Unit Testing: Used React Testing Library to test component functionality.
        End-to-End Testing: Used Cypress to simulate user interactions across workflows.
        Addressed usability feedback to refine design and functionality.
